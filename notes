Requirements

Create a Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) calculator using jQuery.

This form should use HTML5 form elements, such as <input type="number">

The form should be accessible. Make sure that every input field has an associated label field.

How to Calculate BAC

    Determine the total liquid ounces of alcohol consumed
        1 beer = 0.54 liquid ounces of alcohol
        1 glass of wine = 0.6 liquid ounces of alcohol
        1 shot = 0.6 liquid ounces of alcohol
        If someone drank 2 beers, their total liquid ounces is 2 * 0.54
        If someone drank 1 beer and 1 glass of wine, their total liquid ounces is 0.54 + 0.6
    Multiply the result of step 1 by 7.5, which is the average alcohol absorption rate
    Divide the result of step 2 by the person's weight (in pounds) to determine their BAC
    From the result of step 3, subtract 0.015 for each hour since their first drink
        For example, if the person's first drink was 3 hours ago, subtract (3 * 0.015)
    Round the result of step 4 to three decimal places
        For example, 0.080%


Testing

To test your application, a 150 pound person who drinks 2 beers would have a BAC of 0.039% after one hour.
